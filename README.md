## Overview

Week 5 marks the transition from learning individual Java concepts to building cohesive, working systems focused on data input/output and metadata manipulation. Each mini-project demonstrates key Java concepts such as file handling, JSON parsing, annotations, and reflection in practical scenarios.

---

## Day 1: 01 CSV Data Handling

- Reading and writing CSV files using Java I/O streams.
- Parsing CSV data into Java objects for easier manipulation.
- Handling file exceptions and ensuring resource management.
- Using collections to store and process CSV data efficiently.
- Utilities for data extraction and transformation from CSV format.

---

## Day 2: 02 JSON Data

- JSON serialization and deserialization using libraries like Jackson or Gson.
- Mapping JSON structures to Java models.
- Validating JSON data before processing.
- Parsing nested JSON objects and arrays.
- Simulating RESTful data exchanges using JSON.

---

## Day 3: 03 Submission of Annotations, Reflection

- Creating and applying custom annotations in Java.
- Inspecting annotations and class metadata at runtime with Reflection API.
- Building utilities that dynamically process annotations.
- Use cases including runtime validation and dynamic method invocation.
- Exploring annotation retention policies and meta-annotations.

---

## Tools and Technologies

- Java SE 8+  
- Java File Handling (FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter)  
- Java Collections Framework (List, Map)  
- JSON Libraries: Jackson or Gson  
- Java Annotations and Reflection API
